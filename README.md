This project is just usded to try Openstack Placement.

Most of code are hardcode.

With this code, you can under statck Openstack Placement easily.

We can parser argument and tap complement to make it as cli.
And make good organization for the code architecture.

But this beyond the goal of the original intention.
Just learn Placement and know how to use it as as quickly as possible.

Assume that you have install placement and keystone.

Just run:
$ ./cmd.py

You can edit any of the flow in the ./cmd.py as you want.
